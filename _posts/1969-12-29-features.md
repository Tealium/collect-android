### <a id="remote-config"></a>Remote Configuration

The AudienceStream Library has a number of settings configurable in [TealiumIQ](https://my.tealiumiq.com):

* Event Batch Size
 * Size of batch needed to send back data (0 or 1 = no batching). Default value is 1 dispatch.
* WiFi Only Sending
 * By enabling ON, events will only send when the user's device is connected to WiFi. Default value is OFF.
* Battery Saver
 * By enabling ON, data will only be sent when the device has adaquate battery levels. Default value is ON.
* Offline Dispatch Limit (Cache Size)
 * Number of events and views to store on the device until ready to send (0 = no offline dispatching, -1 = no limit). Default value is -1 dispatch.
* Dispatch Expiration
 * How long the data persists (Day(s)) in the app if no data has been sent (-1 = no dispatch expiration). Default value is -1.

To access these settings in [TealiumIQ](https://my.tealiumiq.com);

### <a id="trace"></a>Trace 

Visitor Trace provides the necessary tools to put your AudienceStream configuration to the test. With Visitor Trace, you can observe every detail of your desired workflow, ensure attributes are updated correctly, rules are dialed in, and actions fire as desired. And of course, Visitor Trace is real-time, so you know immediately what works and what needs adjusting.

To join a Trace, call the [joinTrace]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadoc/com/tealium/audiencestream/AudienceStream.html#joinTrace(java.lang.String)) method:
  
```java
AudienceStream.joinTrace(String traceId)
```

where the ```traceId``` is the active trace id.

To leave a trace call the [leaveTrace]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadoc/com/tealium/audiencestream/AudienceStream.html#leaveTrace()) method:

```java
AudienceStream.leaveTrace()
```

Please note that the trace does not survive application restarts, so if you wish to run a trace before dispatching any other events, be sure to call the ```joinTrace``` method right after [library initialization](getting-started.html#enable).

### <a id="verification"></a>Verification

AudienceStream has a number of discovery and verification tools, which are found under the ```Discover``` tab in the AudienceStream Dashboard:

#### Live Events

Live Events provides a real-time feed of the data generated by visitor activity on your app: 

![Live Events]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/live-events.png)

#### API Sampler

The API Sampler Query Builder lets you search for and retrieve visitor profile data:

### <a id="profile"></a>Visitor Profile

A *Visitor Profile* is available through the [getCachedProfile
]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadoc/com/tealium/audiencestream/AudienceStream.html#getCachedProfile()) property and provided to an [AudienceStream.OnProfileUpdatedListener]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadoc/com/tealium/audiencestream/AudienceStream.OnProfileUpdatedListener.html) when added to [AudienceStream.getEventListeners()]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadoc/com/tealium/audiencestream/AudienceStream.html#getEventListeners()). The ```AudienceStream.OnProfileUpdatedListener``` will receive updates when the *Visitor Profile* is updated. 

NOTE: If there are no ```EventListener```s in the ```AudienceStream.getEventListeners()``` collection, the ```getCachedProfile``` will always return null.

A profile offers several different global AudienceStream Attributes and [CurrentVisit]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadoc/com/tealium/audiencestream/visitor/CurrentVisit.html) information detailed in its [API]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadoc/com/tealium/audiencestream/visitor/Profile.html).
